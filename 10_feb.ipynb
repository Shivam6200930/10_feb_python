    "The close() function in Python is used to close a file that has been previously opened using the open() function. It's important to close a file after you have finished reading from it or writing to it. Failing to close a file can have several implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resource Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a file is opened, system resources are allocated to handle the file operations. These resources may include file descriptors or handles.\n",
    "Closing the file releases these resources back to the operating system, ensuring that the system does not run out of available resources when dealing with many files or over an extended period.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file ensures that all the data written to it is properly flushed and saved to the file on disk. If you don't close the file, there's a risk that some data might be left in the buffer and not written to the file, leading to potential data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Closing files helps maintain code consistency and readability. It makes the code more modular and ensures that the file is explicitly marked as no longer in use within a specific code block.\n",
    "Lock Release:\n",
    "\n",
    "On some systems, if a file is opened without closing it, it might be locked for further access by other processes or programs. Closing the file releases any locks, allowing other processes to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Resource Leaks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In long-running programs or scripts, not closing files can lead to resource leaks, where system resources are tied up unnecessarily. This can affect the performance and stability of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To close a file, you can use the close() method on the file object, like this:\n",
